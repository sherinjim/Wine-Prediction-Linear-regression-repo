## Introduction

In this project, we explore a dataset of red wines and aim to predict the quality of wines based on factors such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc. The Linear Regression model is employed to establish a relationship between these features and the wine quality.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [winequality-red dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) obtained from Kaggle. It contains various attributes of red wines along with their quality ratings.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features that could impact the wine quality prediction.

3. **Model Building:** Implementing a Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherinjim

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Wine-Quality-Prediction.ipynb

##Usage

Follow the Jupyter Notebook (`Wine-Quality-Prediction.ipynb`) to see the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Results

The model's predictions are presented in the notebook along with evaluation metrics. The performance of the model can be assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
